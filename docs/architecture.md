# Architecture

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| UI framework | React + Vite | Component-based, fast dev server, scales cleanly as more screens/modes get added. |
| State | React `useState`/`useMemo`, no external store | The state graph is small (current screen, current lesson's round/progress) — a store like Redux/Zustand would be overhead for this size. |
| Persistence | Browser `localStorage` | No login needed for a two-person project; progress just needs to survive a page reload on the same device/browser. |
| Content | Static JSON (`src/data/words.json`, `src/data/verbs.json`, `src/data/compounds.json`) | Word/verb/compound banks are hand-curated and small; no need for a database or CMS. |
| Hosting | Static site (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages) | The whole app is a static bundle — no backend to run or pay for. |

## Component / data flow

![Architecture diagram](images/architecture.png)

- **`src/data/words.json`** is the noun/vocab bank; **`src/data/verbs.json`** is the verb-conjugation bank; **`src/data/compounds.json`** is the multi-emoji compound-concept bank — all pure data, no logic.
- **`src/lib/lessons.js`** decides what content the *next* lesson draws from: `currentWordPool`/`currentVerbPool`/`currentCompoundPool` (the difficulty ramp), `buildLessonContext` (bundles all three into one object), `activeQuestionTypes` (which question types are unlocked so far), and the extend-past-10 rule — pure functions, no React.
- **`src/lib/emoji.js`** — `pickEmoji(word)` picks one emoji from a word's `emoji` plus any `emojiVariants` each time it's asked, so a word with more than one valid emoji (e.g. a cat) doesn't always show the same glyph.
- **`src/lib/questionTypes/`** is the question-type registry — see [Question types](#question-types) below.
- **`src/lib/round.js`** picks a random target + 3 distractors from whatever pool it's handed; used by any multiple-choice question type (`emoji-match`, `reverse-match`, `sentence-fill`, `compound-match`, `gender-match`).
- **`src/lib/dates.js`** has the date helpers shared by the progress hook and the home screen: `dateKey`, `recentDays`, and `currentStreak`.
- **`src/lib/progressFile.js`** — `downloadProgress(progress)` and `parseProgressFile(file)`, the export/import logic (see [Progress export/import](#progress-exportimport) below).
- **`src/hooks/useProgress.js`** owns everything persisted: the full history of completed lessons and which calendar days had activity. It exposes two write paths — `recordLessonCompletion(correct, total)`, called once when a lesson finishes, and `replaceProgress(newProgress)`, called on a successful import. Exiting a lesson early calls neither.
- **`src/App.jsx`** is a tiny screen router with three states: `home`, `lesson`, `results`. It's also where a lesson's content (`buildLessonContext`) and unlocked question types (`activeQuestionTypes`) are picked the moment "New Lesson" is pressed, and where the streak shown on the results screen is computed. No game logic lives here beyond that wiring.
- **`src/components/Home.jsx`** — the home screen: streak header, `ActivityHeatmap`, the "New Lesson" button, and the export/import buttons.
- **`src/components/Lesson.jsx`** — plays one lesson: the round loop, the question-10 extend check, the progress bar. It knows nothing about *what kind* of question it's showing — it asks the registry for one and renders whatever comes back (see below).
- **`src/components/questions/`** — one renderer component per question type, plus the registry (`QuestionRenderer`) that picks the right one, and `optionClassName.js`, a small shared helper so every choice-based renderer gets the same correct/incorrect/disabled styling without depending on each other.
- **`src/components/OptionButton.jsx`** — presentational, used by `EmojiMatchQuestion`, `CompoundMatchQuestion`, and `GenderMatchQuestion` (all have article+pt+gender-shaped choices); the other choice-based renderers (`ReverseMatchQuestion`, `SentenceFillQuestion`) render their own buttons since their content (an emoji, a bare word) doesn't fit that layout, but share its feedback-class logic via `optionClassName.js`.
- **`src/components/LessonResults.jsx`** — the post-lesson score screen, including the updated streak.
- **`src/components/VersionBadge.jsx`** — the small commit-SHA link in the bottom corner, present on every screen. Reads a `__COMMIT_SHA__` global that `vite.config.js` injects at build time via `define`: it's `VITE_COMMIT_SHA` (set by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `github.sha`) in CI, or the local working tree's `git rev-parse HEAD` otherwise, so it's meaningful in `npm run dev`/`build` too, not just the deployed site.

## Question types

Every question in a lesson is a plain data object plus a matching renderer, looked up by `type` — this is what makes adding a new kind of exercise additive rather than a rewrite of `Lesson.jsx`. Six are implemented:

| Type | Prompt | Answer | Content pool |
|---|---|---|---|
| `emoji-match` | emoji | pick the word (4 choices) | `words` |
| `reverse-match` | word | pick the emoji (4 choices) | `words` |
| `compound-match` | 2-3 emoji together | pick the word/phrase (4 choices) | `compounds` |
| `type-in` | emoji | type the word (free text) | `words` |
| `gender-match` | emoji + ♂/♀ symbol | pick the sex-matching word form (4 choices) | `words` (entries with `femaleForm`) |
| `sentence-fill` | emoji + pronoun | pick the conjugated verb form (4 choices) | `verbs` |

- **`src/lib/questionTypes/<type>.js`** — the logic half. Exports `type` (a string id), `generate(context, avoidWordId) -> Question`, and `isCorrect(question, answer) -> boolean`. `context` is the `{ words, verbs, compounds }` object from `buildLessonContext` — each module reads whichever field(s) it needs.
- **`src/lib/questionTypes/index.js`** — the registry. `generateQuestion(type, context, avoidWordId)` and `checkAnswer(question, answer)` dispatch to the right module by `question.type`. This is the only file that needs a new line added when a question type is added.
- **`src/components/questions/<Type>Question.jsx`** — the rendering half: takes `{ question, feedback, onAnswer }` and renders the prompt + answer UI, calling `onAnswer(answer)` when the player responds. `feedback` is `{ correct, answer }` once one has been submitted, or `null` before that.
- **`src/components/questions/index.jsx`** — the component registry (`QuestionRenderer`), keyed the same way as the logic registry above. It renders with `key={question.id}` so any question-local UI state (e.g. `TypeInQuestion`'s text input) resets between questions, even two of the same type back to back.

`Lesson.jsx` only ever calls `generateQuestion`, `checkAnswer`, and renders `<QuestionRenderer />` — it has no `if (type === ...)` branches, so it doesn't grow as question types are added. New types don't appear in every lesson from the moment they're registered, either — see `activeQuestionTypes` in [design.md](design.md#question-types) for the unlock progression. See [data-model.md](data-model.md#question-schema) for the exact `Question`/`Answer` shape.

## Lesson flow

![Lesson flow diagram](images/lesson-flow.png)

A lesson is 10 questions minimum. At question 10, the running correct-count decides whether it extends — see [design.md](design.md#lesson-length-and-the-extend-rule) for the exact rule and the reasoning behind it.

## Progress export/import

`src/lib/progressFile.js` is plain, framework-free logic:

- `downloadProgress(progress)` — serializes the `progress` object to a JSON `Blob` and triggers a browser download via a throwaway `<a download>` element. No confirmation, since exporting is non-destructive.
- `parseProgressFile(file)` — reads a `File` (from a file `<input>`), `JSON.parse`s it, and validates the result actually has the progress shape (an array `history` of `{ completedAt, correct, total }` and an object `activityByDate` of `{ lessonsCompleted }`) before returning it. Throws a descriptive `Error` on anything that doesn't match, which `Home.jsx` catches and displays inline — nothing is ever applied to `progress` from an unvalidated file.

`Home.jsx` wires these to a hidden file `<input>` and a native `window.confirm()` (the only confirmation dialog in the app, since import is the only destructive action — it fully replaces `progress` via `replaceProgress`). See [data-model.md](data-model.md#progress-file-import--export) for the exact validation rules and [ux-ui.md](ux-ui.md#export--import-progress) for the UI.

## Why no backend

The two questions that usually justify a backend — "does progress need to sync across devices?" and "does someone need to log in?" — were both answered no. `useProgress.js` is the single seam to swap if that changes later: it already isolates all read/write of progress behind `progress`, `recordLessonCompletion`, and `replaceProgress`, so replacing `localStorage` with an API call wouldn't touch `Lesson.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, or `LessonResults.jsx`. Export/import (above) is the manual, no-backend stand-in for cross-device sync in the meantime.
